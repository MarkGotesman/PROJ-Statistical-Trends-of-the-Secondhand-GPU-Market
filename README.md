## Abstract
The present paper analyzed data from eBay to reach conclusions about the state of the used GPU market in Q1 2023. The data (N= ~10,000) was collected and processed by the author for the sake of the paper. Research questions sought to ascertain basic features of the marketplace and what a buyer might consider when shopping for a used GPU. These included the difference in listed and sold postings to the site, changes in variance due to the age of the card, and market preference for a certain board partner. This paper begins an exploration of what could be even deeper insight into the marketplace arising from more sophisticated tools.
